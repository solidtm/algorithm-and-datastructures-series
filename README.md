# Algorithm and Datastructures Series


Welcome to the WWCode Lagos Algorithms and Datastructures series repo! This is or was (depending on when are you are seeing this repo ðŸ˜Š) used to track a bi-weekly series on learning various algorithms and data structure concepts. 

You can use this repo as a self-serve learning platform to help you in preparing for technical interviews.


<br>


## **How To Use This Repo**

You're starting at the right place! This file contains general resources and links to pages on specific concepts. 

For each concept, you find the recorded session from the bi-weekly meetup, the slides used during the meetup, resources and practice problems on the concept.

You also find solutions to the practice problems solved by others in the community.


<br>
  
  
## **How To Contribute**

We are encouraging you to solve the practice problems after learning through each concept and also send us a pull request of your working solution in any language.

If you also solved an interesting problem related to any concept, or you find an helpful resource, feel free to send us a pull request of it. 

If you've never contributed to open-source before, let this be your first contribution!Â [Here's a step by step reference](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)Â to contributing.

If you are a more advanced coder, we would welcome your help reviewing PRs of code solutions and provide helpful feedback on best practices.
