## What are Queues

- First in, First out (FIFO) e.g. people on a queue.
- Enqueue to add element to the back of the queue.
- Dequeue to remove element from the front of the queue.
- Add at one end, remove from the other end.

<br>

### Usage

**Current applications:**

- Job queues (printers).
- Processing requests (web servers).
- CPU and disk scheduling.
- Process synchronization.
- Call centers.

**How you can use them:**

- Breadth-first search.
- Maintaining order.
- Concurrent programming.

<br>

### Types of Queue:

- Simple Queue.
- Circular Queue.
- Priority Queue.
- Double Ended Queue (Deque).

<br>
<br>
<br>

## What are Stacks

- Last in, First out (LIFO) e.g. stack of books or plates.
- Push to add element to the top of the stack.
- Pop to remove element from the top of the stack.
- Add and remove from one end.

<br>

### Usage

**Current applications:** 

- Back button in browsers.
- Function call stack.

**How you can use them:** 

- Depth-first search.
- Replace recursion.
- String parsing.
- Reversing.
- Evaluating expressions.

## Things to Note

- Space complexity; most times it is O(n).
- Time complexity; deletion and insertion O(1), visiting all elements O(n).
- How they are implemented, try implementing one with a list.
- How common operations work.

<br>


### Common Operations

- Adding an element.
- Removing an element.
- Checking if it is empty.
- Checking if it full.
- Peek - looking at the top or front element without removing.
