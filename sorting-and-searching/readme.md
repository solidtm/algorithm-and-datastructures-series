## Common Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble sort: swapping until list is sorted
- Selection sort: select minimum and move to front until list is sorted
- Insertion sort: assume first element is sorted, insert every other element in proper position, by shifting elements when needed
- Merge sort: divide until 1 or 2 elements left, then build back up
- Quick sort: select a pivot, then rearrange element around pivot
- Counting sort: count and recreate the elements

## Common Searching Algorithms

- Linear search: sequentially search from start to end until element is found
- Binary search: divide and conquer, reducing search space
- Jump search: search by skipping over a fixed size of elements

<br>


## When to Use

- Search in a sorted array:
- Search in an unsorted array:
- Insert into a sorted array:
- Merge two or k sorted arrays:
- Sort an array of just 2 types of element:
